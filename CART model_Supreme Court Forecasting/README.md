# The project is part of the MITx Analytics Edge course

Part of the course is directed toward explaining end-to-end how to apply, build, and assess tree models.

The project aims to show the following:
* build decision tree models
* visualize the decision tree model
* evaluate the model using a classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy metric
